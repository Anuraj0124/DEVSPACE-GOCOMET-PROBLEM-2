# Problem Statement

Manufacturing Companies require a lot of raw materials to be supplied from one or more vendor companies regularly to keep up with production. A simple way of procuring the raw materials is through emailing the vendor companies about the requirements, and then negotiating through a trail of emails which is not only time consuming but quite difficult to document and hence becomes a logistical nightmare.

# Proposed Solution

We propose a solution where we create a web app with two portals (one for buyers and one for sellers), a platform where all the companies be it manufacturing or vendor can assemble and carry out their transactions and dealings quickly, effectively and hassle-free. One of the ways we've approached this problem is by modularising various aspects of the project including creation of requests which is done semi-automatically. The vendor companies can see the requests created and make their agreement proposals through the portal itself. Then the negotiations can start without the companies being in direct contact with each other and leaving a trail of mails. After the deadline of the request, the buyer can select the best option for their company. At various points during the negotiation, we've given the option to opt out of a proposed solution if the vendor companies don't view the transaction in their best interests.
